/**
 * The harness folder is plumbing only (Decision 48) — the "block" half.
 *
 * Agents are TOLD where their work belongs (the folder line in their prompt);
 * this refuses a file-writing tool call that lands in the harness folder anyway,
 * unless it is one of the few files the hive protocol itself tells agents to
 * write. The refusal reason goes straight back to the agent, so it names where
 * the work should go instead and the agent can correct itself.
 *
 * LIMITS, stated plainly:
 *  - Only Claude's file tools (Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit) are checked.
 *    A shell command that writes a file can't be judged from its text.
 *  - The PreToolUse hook fails OPEN when the agent's shim can't reach the app's
 *    socket, so this is a strong guard, not an airtight one.
 *
 * Pure: no fs, no electron. The hook server supplies the paths.
