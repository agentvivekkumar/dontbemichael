/**
 * Office Pack loader — the bundled packs, read from disk and merged with core.
 *
 * `src/shared/officePack.ts` owns the FORMAT (what a valid pack is, what an
 * imported one may grant). This module owns GETTING them: where the files live
 * in dev versus a packaged app, which ones are readable, and what the caller
 * sees when one is broken.
 *
 * Path resolution mirrors `skillsResourceDir()` in `index.ts` exactly, because
 * packs ship the same way skills do — a directory copied into `extraResources`,
 * so `<resourcesPath>/packs` in the packaged app and `resources/packs` in dev.
 *
 * FAILURE POSTURE: a broken pack never takes the others down. Onboarding's first
 * screen is a grid of business types, and one malformed file must not empty that
 * grid — the owner would see a dead first screen with nothing to click. Each file
 * is read and validated on its own; the bad one is reported and skipped, and the
 * rest still load. A test (`office-pack-fixtures.test.cjs`) keeps the shipped
 * files valid so this path stays theoretical for bundled packs.
 *
 * Electron is imported ONLY for the path lookup, behind an injectable seam, so
 * the loader can be unit-tested under plain node like `integrationBroker.ts` is.
