/**
 * Write a file so a crash or power loss never leaves it half written.
 *
 * The data goes to a temporary file beside the target, is flushed to disk, and
 * only then is renamed over the target (rename is atomic on the same volume).
 * A reader sees the old file or the new one, never a torn mix. If anything
 * fails, the temporary file is removed and the old file is left untouched.
 *
 * First user: the secret store (integrations.ts), which holds every saved
 * password and key (mailboxes, engines, integrations) in one file, so a torn
 * write would lose all of them at once.
 *
 * Electron-free, and `ops` is injectable, so tests can fail any step.
