/**
 * The distinct job check the hire wizard runs on Review (design D6: "make a much
 * more thorough check of existing agent profiles and only allow if the new hire
 * job description is sufficiently distinct or particular such as bound to a
 * specific mailbox or specific topic").
 *
 * A hidden Claude call (Haiku, no tools: it only reads text) compares the new
 * job with every teammate's profile and answers JSON. When the call fails or
 * answers junk, the instant rules decide instead and the verdict says so, so a
 * sign-in problem never blocks hiring for good.
