/**
 * Where each agent's folder lives on the owner's disk (Decisions 44, 45).
 *
 * An agent works INSIDE its folder: what it reads for context and what it
 * produces both live there. Unless the owner points it somewhere else, a folder
 * is `~/Documents/<Business name>/<Folder>`, and Michael plus every agent share
 * `~/Documents/<Business name>/Office`.
 *
 * Both names arrive from outside: the business name is typed by the owner, and
 * a folder name comes from a pack that may have been imported. So both are
 * cleaned into one safe folder name, and the final path is checked to still be
 * inside the business folder before anything is created.
 *
 * Creation only ever ADDS a missing folder. An existing folder, and anything in
 * it, is left exactly as it is.
