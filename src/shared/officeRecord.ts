/**
 * The office's own record of who it is: `<harnessHome>/office.json`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Setup used to derive everything from what the owner typed:
 * the team's folders are `~/Documents/<Business name>/<Folder>`. After a
 * reinstall (or a new data folder, as on 2026-09-24) setup runs again, and a
 * business name typed slightly differently pointed the team at new, empty
 * folders while the real office sat untouched in the home folder. The office
 * folder is the one thing that survives a reinstall, so the office describes
 * itself there, and setup recognises it by folder, never by name.
 *
 * The record is written by config:update only when a save changes the office's
 * own fields (touchesOffice), never when a save only switches offices, and is
 * backfilled at launch (backfillOfficeRecord) only when the config's team
 * matches the office's registry. An office without one is described from its
 * hive registry instead (`officeRecordFromRegistry`).
 *
 * Pure data and pure functions; the file I/O lives in src/main/officeFile.ts.
