/**
 * Agent Definition v2 — what an agent is, in the owner's terms.
 *
 * The shareable hire manifest (`hire.ts`) describes an agent as a spawn command:
 * provider, model, flags, a goal string. That is a developer's view. A business
 * owner needs a different one, and eng review Decisions 2, 4 and 9 fixed it:
 *
 *   role       — "Admin", "Customer Care": the job title on the card
 *   does       — plain-language rules the owner can edit
 *   wontDo     — the same, for what the agent leaves alone
 *   tools      — per-capability level: off | ask | auto
 *   connections— which configured connections this agent may use
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS FILE IS NOT:
 *
 * 1. It is NOT the enforcement point. `does`/`wontDo` compile into prompt text,
 *    which is reinforcement only. A level is enforced by the broker (it holds the
 *    credential) and by the PreToolUse allowlist hook — see Decision 9. Anything
 *    here is a declaration of intent that those layers then honour.
 * 2. It does NOT own connections. Connections are configured once, centrally
 *    (Decision 9); an agent references them by id and carries only the levels.
 *    Two agents sharing one mailbox produce one credential record, not two.
 *
 * Levels, in the owner's words on the setup screen:
 *   'off'  — "Off": the capability is denied; the tool is not offered and the
 *            broker refuses the call even if the agent finds another route.
 *   'ask'  — "Ask me": the call becomes a pending approval the owner acts on
 *            later, possibly hours later (Decisions 3, 10, 31).
 *   'auto' — "On its own": the call proceeds unattended.
 *
 * Every record carries `schemaVersion` (Decision 23). Owners auto-update, so a
 * build from January will read records written by a build from March: an older
 * record is upgraded on read, and a NEWER one is refused with a plain message
 * rather than a parse error.
