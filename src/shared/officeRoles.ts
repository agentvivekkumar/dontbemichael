/**
 * Each Office character's job — the same in every business type, the way it was
 * in the show (owner's rule, 2026-09-23).
 *
 * A business type chooses WHICH characters are on its team and how each job
 * reads for that trade (a restaurant's Oscar watches food cost; a CPA's watches
 * retainers). It never changes WHAT the job is: Oscar is always finance, Dwight
 * always sales. `office-pack-fixtures.test.cjs` holds every shipped pack to this
 * map, so a pack can't quietly give a character a different job again.
 *
 * Michael is not here: he is the office manager on every team, not a pack role.
