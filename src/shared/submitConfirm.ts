 * Confirm that a line typed into an agent's terminal was actually submitted
 * (2026-10-03). Text and its Enter go as two writes 140 ms apart so the TUI
 * reads the Enter as a keystroke, not as part of a paste. That gap only holds
 * while the agent reads its input promptly: Oscar, just resumed on a 174k
 * conversation, read three nudges and their Enters as bursts, so the first
 * Enter became a line break in his input box, the second vanished, and he sat
 * on closing time until a third arrived. Nothing noticed, because nothing
 * checked.
 *
 * Claude Code fires UserPromptSubmit for every prompt it accepts, so the
 * typing side waits for it and presses Enter again when it does not come. An
 * extra Enter on an empty prompt does nothing, so a slow confirmation costs
 * nothing; a missed one now submits what was typed.
