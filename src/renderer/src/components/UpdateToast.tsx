/**
 * Auto-update toast (v0.3.4) — the visual half of the background updater.
 *
 * Main's updater (src/main/updater.ts) downloads a new release in the
 * background and pushes ONE of two states over `update:status`:
 *   - 'downloaded'        → the update is staged; offer "restart to update".
 *   - 'available-manual'  → this install can't self-update (win-portable,
 *                           updater error); offer a link to the release page.
 *
 * Mirrors CompletionToast: self-contained + self-subscribing, mounted once in
 * App.tsx, renders nothing when idle. Installation is ALWAYS user-initiated —
 * "later" just hides the toast until the next app start (or the 6h re-check).
 *
 * ─── v0.4.4: "What's new" ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Both states already carried `notes` (the GitHub release body) and the toast
 * dropped it on the floor, so the only notification this app ever raises said
 * nothing but a version number. It now renders a digest of that body —
 * summarizeReleaseNotes() in src/shared/releaseNotes.ts does the parsing, and
 * lives there rather than here so it can be unit-tested without a renderer.
 *
 * Three rules this block obeys:
 *   1. No notes, no block. A release body that is missing, empty, or pure
 *      structure yields an empty digest and the toast renders EXACTLY as it did
 *      before — no orphan heading, no shifted buttons. Most bodies are like
 *      that, so this is the common path, not the edge case.
 *   2. Bounded height. The digest is capped in releaseNotes.ts AND clamped with
 *      a scroll here, because a toast that grows with the release notes is a
 *      dialog that covers the app.
 *   3. The star ask is shown AT MOST ONCE EVER, not once per release. A repeated
 *      ask is the kind of nagging that gets a notification muted, which would
 *      cost the updater its only channel. See STAR_ASK_KEY below.
 *
 * No new IPC and no new network call: "read more" reuses `updateOpenRelease`
 * (the same bridge the manual state's button has always used) and the star link
 * goes through the existing `openExternal` opener.
