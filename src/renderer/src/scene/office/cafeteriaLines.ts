// The studio's idle talk, The Office edition (branding/DESIGN.md 8.8).
//
// The cast ARE Dunder Mifflin (see cast.ts), so a quiet team member says a line
// in character. Two kinds:
//   * solo: one line on the speaker's chip. createIdleLines deals the
//     speaker's own lines about 60% of the time, else a break-room line
//     (SHARED_SOLO), never repeating until a pool runs out.
//   * pair: an exchange two quiet people trade as paper planes or envelopes.
//     createBanter deals EXCHANGES, the "that's what she said" bits and each
//     character's signature opener, and only to a pair who would say them on
//     the show: Michael lands "that's what she said", Andy went to Cornell.
//
// Lines are kept short for the 250 px quote bubble. Character keys match
// OfficeCharacterName.
