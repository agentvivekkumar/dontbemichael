## Architecture

Two data planes feed one renderer:

```

- **Terminal plane.** The main process owns a `PtyManager` that spawns each agent as a `node-pty`
  process and streams output over per-id IPC (`pty:data:<id>`). The renderer talks only through a
  typed `window.cth` bridge ([`src/preload/index.ts`](../src/preload/index.ts)), which also exposes
  sandboxed filesystem and git helpers.
- **Hive / event plane.** `hive.ts` is the on-disk multi-agent layer; `hooks.ts` runs the hook
  server that provider bridges POST lifecycle payloads to (`cth-hook` for Claude Code, `agy-hook`
  for Antigravity). `memory.ts` wraps the semantic memory CLI. The router delivers messages, drains
  provider outboxes, the GOD agent adjudicates, and idle/inbox wakeups keep workers draining mail.

## Project structure

```
src/
  main/                      Electron main process (Node)
    index.ts                 window, IPC handlers, quit guard

    bundledSkills.ts         native workspace skill provisioning for Codex and Gemini
    hooks.ts                 hook server + provider hook shims (`cth-hook`, `agy-hook`)
    hookShell.ts             the shell Claude Code runs hooks and the status line in (bash, or PowerShell on Windows
                             without Git Bash), and each hook command written for it
    memory.ts                semantic memory layer (CLI wrapper, degrade-to-noop)
    config.ts                harness config persistence + home setup; Claude Code's ~/.claude.json (folder trust,
                             the first-run welcome, an approved API key), written to a copy and swapped in;
                             folder trust is keyed as Claude Code looks it up (forward slashes on Windows, claudeProjectKey)
    engineSetup.ts           Get Michael ready: finds Claude without a shell, Claude's standalone install script,
                             sign in state (`claude auth status`), the Anthropic API key check
                             (docs/designs/get-michael-ready.md; status types in shared/engineSetup.ts)
    transcript.ts            reads ~/.claude/projects/ JSONL transcripts for real token/cost telemetry

    mailApprovals.ts         Send on approval's store (mail-proposals.json in the app's data folder): emails waiting on
                             Ask me, the owner's decisions, standing approvals, Send only send records and pauses,
                             and the Sending changed notice that hands waiting emails back on Can send
                             (docs/designs/send-on-approval.md, shared-mailboxes.md; the rules are in shared/mailProposals.ts)
    standingCheck.ts         the separate quick check (hidden Claude, no tools) that an email fits a standing approval;
                             anything it can't read counts as no, so the email goes to the owner
    integrations.ts          the secret store: every saved password and key in one safeStorage-encrypted file
                             (integration-secrets.json in userData, 0600); refuses to save over a file it can't read
    atomicFile.ts            crash-safe file write (temp file, fsync, rename); the secret store's writer
    closingTime.ts           Closing Time shutdown protocol (the office reopens on next launch, shared/officeOpen.ts)
                             The closing time bar (ClosingTimeBar) lists who is still working (hook `detail` from hooks.ts toolDetail),
                             with Remind and Close without them (never pty:kill: that archives the agent).
                             start({relaunch}) reopens the app once closed (a Claude Code update, shared/cliUpdate.ts)

    hireCheck.ts             the hire wizard's distinct job check (hidden Claude call, rules as fallback)
    workStyleConvert.ts      turns a plain work style into an agent's instructions and back, and writes the

                             off by default, then per agent;
                             books roles like Oscar default to Read only)

Codex and Gemini worker startup exposes bundled skills individually in the worker's
working folder under `.agents/skills`. Links target the app's resource directory,
so removing another worker's private folder does not break them. Windows uses
directory junctions, with a copy fallback when links are unavailable. An ownership
record lets restart refresh or retire unchanged app entries while preserving owner
skills in `.agents/skills` and `.gemini/skills`, including edited fallback copies.
The existing private `.claude/skills` copy remains available to bundled helper
commands through `AGENT_DIR`. Provisioning failures go to the hive log and worker
startup continues. Workspace trust and skill activation follow each CLI's rules;
engine availability still follows `BUILD_ENGINES`.

## Design system

The look is **Studio** (design system v2): a calm isometric office drawn in SVG, with Sora for
the interface and JetBrains Mono for data, in light and dark. [`branding/DESIGN.md`](../branding/DESIGN.md)
is canonical; every component derives from its tokens (`src/renderer/src/design/`). Team members
are the cast of *The Office*, each shown as a pod in their department's color.
