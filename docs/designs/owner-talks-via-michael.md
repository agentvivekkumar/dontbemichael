# The owner talks to team members through Michael, except in 1:1

Status: design reviewed (2026-09-25).

## Proposal (owner, 2026-09-25)

Today the owner can message any agent directly, bypassing Michael. Disallow this unless
the agent is in 1:1 mode.

## What exists today (from the code)

Three ways the owner reaches a team member directly, in the agent panel
(`AgentDetailPanel.tsx`) and focus mode (`FullscreenTerminal.tsx`):

| # | Channel | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Terminal keyboard (`PtyTerminalView`) | types into the agent's session |
| 2 | Message composer (`MessageQueueComposer`) | queues a message into the agent |
| 3 | "steer" box (`AgentControlStrip`) | a note the agent reads on its next turn |

1:1 already exists: the "1:1" button (`AgentHoldButton.tsx`) sets `onHold` in the registry,
and Michael stops routing work to that agent. Nothing gates the three channels on it.

Constraint: the app itself writes into agent terminals to deliver inbox mail, so the lock
must stop the owner's keystrokes only, never the app's own delivery.

## Design decisions

### 1A. Outside 1:1: watch-only terminal plus a bar (approved 2026-09-25)

- A team member's terminal stays visible and live, but ignores the owner's keystrokes.
  A "watching" tag sits in its top corner.
- The composer is replaced by a bar: "{{name}} takes work from {{godName}}. To ask {{name}}
  something, tell {{godName}}, or talk to {{name}} 1:1." with two buttons:
  `Message {{godName}} about {{name}}` (primary) and `Talk 1:1`.
- In 1:1 (`onHold`), the terminal accepts typing and the composer is back, exactly as today.
- Michael's own panel is unchanged.
- Wireframe: `~/.gstack/projects/agentvivekkumar-dontbemichael/designs/owner-talks-via-michael-20260925/panel.html` (variant A).

### 2A. Steer only in 1:1 (approved 2026-09-25; brakes amended same day)

The steer box is hidden outside 1:1.

**Amended (owner, after the build):** "Block tools" and "stop after this step" are hidden
too, behind `SHOW_AGENT_BRAKES` in `buildFeatures.ts`; the circuit breaker still steps in
on its own. The top "1:1" button is removed: 1:1 lives only at the bottom, "Talk 1:1" in
the bar, and while in 1:1 a line above the message box: "In 1:1 with {{name}}. {{godName}}
sends {{name}} no work until you end it." with `End 1:1`. Outside 1:1 the top strip shows
nothing and is not rendered.

### 3A. An agent stuck on a question routes to Michael, then ASK ME (owner, 2026-09-25)

Owner's direction: "explore if this can be routed to Michael and to ASK ME if Michael can't
help either."

- **Questions the agent asks itself:** for team members, the PreToolUse hook refuses the
  in-terminal question tool (`AskUserQuestion`) with the reason: "Don't ask here. Send the
  question to Michael through your outbox." Michael answers it, or raises it on ASK ME per
  his instructions. (0 uses in current transcripts; this closes the path.)
- **Prompts the session raises** (sign-in, trust this folder, a permission when auto mode is
  off): the `Notification` hook tells Michael with the prompt text. Michael can't type into
  that terminal, so his instructions say to raise it on ASK ME: "{{name}} is waiting on
  something in their terminal: <text>. Talk 1:1 with {{name}} to answer."
- While that agent's status is "needs you", the panel bar leads with "{{name}} is waiting on
  something in their terminal. Talk 1:1 to answer." and `Talk 1:1` becomes the primary button.

### 4A. "Message {{godName}} about {{name}}" jumps to Michael (owner choice 2026-09-25)

Selects Michael, opens his terminal tab, and starts his message box with
"About {{name}}: " (focused, cursor at the end). Nothing is sent until the owner sends it.
(Recommended inline box, 4B, declined.)

## Implementation tasks

- [ ] **M1 (P1)**: gate owner keystrokes into a team member's PTY on `onHold` (renderer: `PtyTerminalView` input handler for non-god agents); app-originated writes (inbox delivery, nudges) untouched. "watching" tag.
- [ ] **M2 (P1)**: replace `MessageQueueComposer` with the bar outside 1:1 (agent panel and focus mode); `Talk 1:1` calls the existing hold toggle.
- [ ] **M3 (P1)**: hide the steer input outside 1:1 in `AgentControlStrip`; keep block tools and stop after this step.
- [ ] **M4 (P1)**: PreToolUse refuses `AskUserQuestion` for non-god agents with the outbox reason; worker briefing line.
- [ ] **M5 (P1)**: Notification hook (permission or elicitation prompt, not idle) sends Michael an inform with the prompt text; Michael's instructions: raise it on ASK ME with "Talk 1:1 to answer".
- [ ] **M6 (P2)**: "Message {{godName}} about {{name}}": select Michael, open his terminal tab, seed his composer "About {{name}}: ".
- [ ] **M7 (P1)**: strings in en, zh-CN, ar (godName interpolated, no dashes); tests: keystrokes dropped outside 1:1 and passed in 1:1, app delivery still writes, steer hidden, question tool refused for workers and allowed for Michael, prompt notification reaches Michael.
