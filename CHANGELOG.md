# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Don't Be Michael keeps its own version line, starting at 0.0.1.

## [0.1.2] (2026-10-05)

### Added

- **A Beta pill beside the version in the top bar,** with a tip that says where Report a problem is. Windows builds now ship with every release.

### Fixed

- The Beta tip in the top bar is never drawn under the Tasks board.

## [0.1.1] (2026-10-05)

### Added

- **Windows 11 (beta).** An x64 installer for Windows 11, built with every release candidate
  and shipped with a release once it passes a check on a real PC. Windows asks once before it
  runs an unsigned app: choose More info, then Run anyway.
- **Open the file a question is about.** When a question on Ask me names a file saved in the
  office (a report, a sheet, a draft), the card lists it with Open, or Show in Finder (Show in
  folder on Windows) for anything that is not a plain document. Task detail lists them too.
- **A Beta pill and Report a problem** in Settings, on Mac and Windows. Report a problem opens
  a GitHub issue with the app version and your system already filled in.

### Changed

- **A question on Ask me never disappears unanswered.** It leaves only when you answer it or
  Michael withdraws it, and Task detail says when one was withdrawn and why. Before, a second
  question on the same card, or a card leaving Blocked, could hide the first. Michael is told
  each turn about cards holding questions the wrong way, so he folds or withdraws them.
- **Your answer goes only to Michael.** He routes it to whoever asked; the floor shows one
  envelope, from you to Michael.
- Closing time and office open notices no longer fly to team members' desks.
- Idle chit chat between team members always uses paper planes. The envelope means a real
  message.
- Closing a card, fixing a mailbox, or finishing a card by voice withdraws its open questions.

### Fixed

- Answering one question could undo Michael withdrawing another on the same card.
- Searching or reading archived and Sent mail gives a clear hint when nothing is found in the
  inbox, instead of an unexplained miss.
- The manual Mac download link points at the universal installer.
- A release candidate build is offered the final release when it ships.

## [0.1.0] (2026-10-04)

### Added

- **A first task is a card.** A new hire's one time first job (build a list, a first sweep, a
  first draft) is no longer a line in their Work style: it becomes a card Michael hands out at
  hire. A First task you type into a Work style, when hiring or in Edit, becomes a card too.
  Existing team members' old First task text is moved out once, and any standing duty it held is
  now a scheduled starter job.
- **A Waiting column on Tasks**, in yellow: a card someone is working on but is waiting for a
  teammate's reply shows who it waits on, instead of sitting in Doing with nobody working.
  Only Michael moves cards into Waiting or Blocked.
- **The floor has character:** each team member has a signature prop as their avatar and on
  their desk, departments have painted floor signs, and the office has plants, a water cooler
  and Michael's mug.
- **Who talks to whom** reads by time: Last 1 hour up to Last 1 month, Last 1 day by default,
  with prop avatars on the graph.
- **Suggest me** on the hire wizard writes a first Work style from the role, what they handle
  and the team, streamed into the field as it is written.
- A team member who needs a fact asks the teammate who has it, and goes to Michael only when
  nobody can help or someone has to do work.
- Every character has break room lines of their own.

### Changed

- Who talks to whom shows teammates talking to each other, and the owner talking only to
  Michael. The Topics layer is gone.
- The side column is hidden on the Tasks and Who talks to whom views, and All clear shows only
  on the office floor.
- The pack caption beside Hire moved into Hire.
- Closing a hire who took work from teammates gives that work back to them, and it returns to
  the hire when they come back. Clone is greyed when every character of that kind is already on
  the team.
- An office with an Operations or team pod keeps the ring layout up to nine pods.
- The office window opens filling the screen.

### Fixed

- Mail tools never read or search drafts, trash, junk or Gmail's system folders, and a long
  label's message id is no longer cut short.
- People who went home at closing time no longer trade paper planes between dark offices.
- An overlap check the owner moved past on the hire wizard is stopped instead of running on.
- Michael's roster names where each team member's mail access comes from.

## [0.0.16] (2026-10-03)

### Added

- **Your Ask me answer is Michael's open work.** It reaches him as a request about the card and
  stays in front of him on every turn until he routes the follow up and closes it. An answer
  whose request did not go out is sent at the next launch. The Tasks view shows those cards as
  With Michael, and as not moved after one work day of your office hours.
- **Every scheduled job has a focus area:** what to concentrate on each time it runs. It is
  written on the job, shown with the team member's Work style, sent only with that job's run,
  and checked against the Work style when you save.
- **Inbox zero for the Executive Admin** in every business type: every email is routed,
  tracked, filed or cleared and leaves the inbox, and nothing is deleted. Her mail tools can now
  archive under a label, mark read and mark junk, and every move is written to the office log.
  A new hire comes with an Inbox to zero job every 2 hours during office hours, and an office
  that hired her before is offered the new job description on Needs you.
- Michael has a Work style like everyone else, with a default for every office. The hourly
  standup's focus is to close your open requests first, then check the floor.

### Changed

- **Blocked always means waiting on you.** A blocked card with nothing on Needs you is shown to
  Michael every turn, and marked Nothing asked on the Tasks view, until he asks you its question
  or moves it on. Only Michael sets Blocked; Task detail and voice no longer offer it.
- **A card ends only as Done.** Dismissing a card, or moving it to Done yourself, closes it as
  Done by your decision, marked Closed by owner, and Michael is told of every card you move or
  close. Nothing in the app deletes a card any more.
- **Closing time:** someone who has gone home is gone from the floor. Their desk goes dark, their
  name leaves the chip, and nothing opens them until you cancel. Michael stays at his desk until
  the office is closed.
- Job descriptions name nobody: role lines and Work styles name teammates by role, so renaming
  anyone never leaves a stale name. Older text that still names someone is updated on rename.
- The menus are trimmed to what the app uses: no File menu on the Mac, and no Reload or developer
  tools in an installed app. The second office window (New Floor) is gone.
- Edit agent is one column over the profile, with the engine folded away, in every language.
  The Needs you column stays open while anything waits on you. Michael's idle notification
  comes at most every few hours.

### Fixed

- Closing time no longer waits forever on Michael: his reply that the office closed reaches the
  closing bar again.
- A message an agent was still writing is no longer thrown away as broken; one that really is
  broken gets the sender a notice, at most every few minutes.
- A message typed into a busy team member's terminal is confirmed as sent, and Enter is pressed
  again only while nobody is typing there.
- An archive label can never name trash, junk or another system folder, or a folder inside one,
  so archiving can never delete or junk mail.
- The launch catch-up only relays answers you gave in the app, word for word, never text an
  agent wrote into a card. Cards answered before this update show to Michael as Blocked with
  nothing asked.
- A message an agent wrote with broken line breaks is archived as it was delivered, so Michael's
  reply in it still closes your request.
- Answering a question on Ask me never erases a newer question added to the card while you typed.
- A job description offer whose Use the new one could not be saved changes nothing and stays
  offered.

## [0.0.15] (2026-10-02)

### Added

- **Claude connectors, under your control.** Settings > Connections now lists every connector
  on your Claude account (HubSpot, Google Drive, Gmail, QuickBooks and the rest), read from
  Claude when the app starts, when you open Connections, and when you press Refresh. Each one
  is off until you turn it on, and a team member uses it only once its Access tab gives it to
  them. Connectors that need sign in link to claude.ai; ones that left your account show
  Removed until you clear them.
- **Restart to apply.** A team member whose connectors change restarts by itself when it is
  idle, in the same conversation, or right away with Restart now on its Access tab, which says
  when it is restarting and when a restart failed.
- **What's new** opens the notes for the version you are on, right under its link in
  Settings > General, in every language.
- The README explains how Don't Be Michael differs from Munder Difflin.

### Changed

- **Agents can no longer reach what you did not give them.** Until now every team member
  could use every connector on your Claude account except QuickBooks and Gmail, and loaded
  your own Claude Code servers and plugin servers. Now each connector is blocked at start up
  and on every call, and calls are refused if the app cannot confirm access. After the update,
  one Ask me card names the connectors that are now off. QuickBooks keeps your switch and each
  team member's choice; Gmail and Google Calendar, if you had them on, stay on for everyone.
- Work a team member hands to a Claude subagent follows the same rules as the team member:
  its connectors, its mailbox and its private folder.
- Settings is simpler: Agents and Autonomy are one tab, About and Updates are one card, the
  Danger zone stands out, and Default MCP servers, Explain things simply, Arabic text in
  terminals and Language are hidden.
- Mailboxes fold into one line with a count and open by themselves when one needs you.
- Schedule rows read in three quiet lines: the job and its next run, when it runs, and how
  the last run went.
- Updates are always checked in installed builds.

### Fixed

- The paper plane two idle teammates throw now points the way it flies.
- Selecting Michael's card draws its outline all the way around.
- A connector call with a large input (a long document) is checked and goes through instead
  of being refused.

### Removed

- The separate QuickBooks section and the "Your Claude account" switch in Mailboxes: both are
  rows in Claude connectors now.
- The automatic updates switch, which no longer did anything.

## [0.0.14] (2026-10-01)

### Changed

- **A new look, Studio.** The pixel floor is gone. The office is now a calm isometric studio:
  each team sits at a pod with a chip over it, lights come up as the office opens, and work
  moves across the floor as it happens (handoffs, mail arriving, Michael's numbers on his
  walls). Every screen, dialog, setup step, Settings field and the release notes use the same
  fonts, colors and inputs, in light and dark.
- **Quiet people still have personality.** Idle team members say lines from The Office, and two
  idle people trade a line by paper plane or envelope, "that's what she said" included.
- **Cards open where they belong.** A quiet pod's card rolls down from under its chip, and
  selecting someone dims everyone else.
- **Needs you is the one number.** The Tasks tab no longer shows its own blocked count.
- **Ask me cards read plainly.** Titles drop ids, dates and bracketed notes, and the answer box
  grows as you type. Talk to Michael (formerly Brief Michael) grows the same way and takes
  pasted screenshots and files.
- **Task detail** puts the title under the id row and shows the card's notes.
- A team member's tabs are now Profile, Access, Messages, Memory and Work (Capabilities became
  Access, Terminal became Work), and Ask me lives on the Needs you board.
- **Closing time runs on the floor**, with Cancel and Force quit in a bar instead of a dialog.
  It now starts from the clock menu too, and open dialogs stay open behind it.

### Removed

- The traces tab, the old command bar, the files tab and other screens nothing opened any more.

## [0.0.13] (2026-09-30)

### Added

- **The app tells you when Claude Code updated under your team.** Claude Code updates itself, but
  agents already running keep the old version until they restart. The app notices within ten
  minutes and shows a "team upgrade ready" chip and a corner note. Your click runs closing time
  (every agent saves and confirms) and then reopens the app on the new version. Nothing restarts
  on its own; "later" hides the note until a newer version arrives.

### Changed

- Closing time can reopen the app when it finishes: the dialog says "reopening" instead of "see
  you tomorrow".

## [0.0.12] (2026-09-30)

### Fixed

- **Saved passwords and keys can't be lost to a crash mid-save.** Every mailbox password, engine
  key and integration secret lives in one file. It is now written to a temporary file, flushed to
  disk and swapped in whole, so a crash, power cut or full disk leaves the old file or the new one,
  never a torn one. A write that stops short is never swapped in.
- **A file that can't be read is never saved over.** If the saved secrets file is there but can't
  be read at that moment, saving a new secret now fails with a message instead of writing a file
  that holds only the new secret and loses all the others.
- The secrets file is always owner-only (0600), even if an older copy was readable by others.

## [0.0.11] (2026-09-30)

### Added

- **QuickBooks through your Claude account, with you in control.** The app does not connect to
  Intuit itself: team members use the QuickBooks connected to your Claude account.
- **One switch in Settings > Connections > QuickBooks, off by default.** Off, no team member can use
  QuickBooks and it doesn't show on anyone's Capabilities. On, the app checks whether your Claude
  account has QuickBooks connected and, if not, shows the steps to connect it in Claude.
- **Who may use it, on each Capabilities tab:** Can use QuickBooks, then Read only or Can make
  changes. Before you choose, Oscar is on and Read only; everyone else is off. A change applies on
  the team member's next step, with no restart.
- **Read only means a fixed list of reads.** Reports, invoices, customers and payroll details to look
  at. Anything else, including any tool Intuit adds later, shopping for loans and peer loan offers,
  is refused until it is known to be safe.

### Known limitation

- The switch and Capabilities are checked on every QuickBooks call a team member makes. A team member
  that starts its own separate Claude from its terminal is outside that check and can reach your
  Claude account's QuickBooks. The same is true today for email through your Claude account. A fix
  is planned (TODOS.md, P1).

## [0.0.10] (2026-09-29)

### Added

- **Closing time shows who is still working.** The quit dialog lists every team member and
  Michael: confirmed, still working, waiting at a prompt, or nothing to do. It also shows what
  each one is doing and for how long, for example "Run the test suite · 7 min". The line is the
  agent's own description of the step, a file name or a site's host, never the command itself. It
  is redacted, cut to one 80-character line, and never saved to disk.
- **Remind.** Sends one agent, or Michael, the closing steps again: a note in their inbox and a
  nudge at their next step. At most once every 30 seconds per agent.
- **Close without them.** Stops waiting for one team member and tells Michael so the office can
  close. Nothing is stopped: the agent keeps its work and its terminal ends with the others when
  the app quits.
- A row goes when that agent's terminal ends, and Michael is told so he stops waiting for it.

### Changed

- Closing time can be started again while it is running, and refuses once the app is already
  closing or when Michael's terminal has ended.

## [0.0.9] (2026-09-28)

No changes to the app itself.

### Removed

- The old project's website files from `docs/`: its pages, CNAME, robots.txt, the Google
  verification file, research notes, the hires gallery, PR evidence, a talk deck, saved Reddit
  threads, badges, the banner and the old logo set with `tools/make-logo.cjs`.
- Its promo media (Pro, Product Hunt, landing demos and explainer clips) and 42 blog posts about
  the old product: launch posts, competitor comparisons, launch stories and guides for features
  this app does not have.

### Changed

- `npm run check:links` checks only `RELEASE.md`.
- `docs/release-drops.md`, `docs/message-queue.md` and `docs/design/knowledge-graph.md` match the
  code again, and code comments say company knowledge is on by default.

## [0.0.8] (2026-09-27)

### Added

- **A new hire wizard: Who, Job, Role, Finalize.** Pick a character and they bring their job: a
  teammate doing it today, or the job from your business pack. Or pick any job from any kind of
  business, or write a new one. Each hire gets its own folder, like Admin_Erin, when Admin is taken.
- **No two teammates do the same work.** A new job is checked against every teammate's by what they
  handle, not by title. An overlap must be bound to its own mailbox or topic before Hire, and the
  teammate's line says the bound work now goes to the new hire.
- **Work style in plain words.** Hiring and Edit Agent show the work style as a plain description
  you can edit; the app writes the agent's instructions from it when you hire or save.
- **One job, several times.** A schedule can have more than one "when" line, for example every 2h
  on weekdays between 08:00 and 18:00 plus weekends at 14:00.
- **Erin joins the cast**, the character tiles are grouped by job with each one's job under the
  name, and every character has break room lines of their own.

### Changed

- **Michael runs the office.** Only Michael assigns work: a teammate asking another teammate to do
  something goes to Michael, and questions between teammates still go straight through. Michael
  decides the team's schedule requests and asks you in ASK ME only when he can't settle one, or
  when he hasn't decided it within 12 hours. Each request says why, and two about the same job
  become one.
- **Schedules offer 4h** in the every… list, a common half day rhythm.
- **One agent per mailbox.** A mailbox another agent checks shows who has it, and moving it asks
  first.
- **The office speaks office.** Agents say "clocking in…" at launch and "nothing to do" when idle,
  the memory graph shows each agent's character, Sadiq wears a turban and Darryl a full beard.
- **Hiring is simpler.** Developer options are hidden: engine and command line, Git isolation,
  projects, resume session and import. Field explanations sit behind info icons.

### Fixed

- **A memory tidy reads only its own answer**, so one agent's notes can no longer land in another
  agent's memory.
- **Closing the hire dialog by accident.** Selecting text past its edge, or pressing Escape in a
  field, no longer closes it, and it can't be closed while Hire is running.

## [0.0.7] (2026-09-26)

### Added

- **Give each agent its own mailbox.** Settings, Connections, Mailboxes connects Gmail, Google
  Workspace, iCloud, Yahoo, Zoho or any IMAP mailbox with an app password. The password is tested
  before it is saved and stays in this Mac's keychain. Outlook is not supported yet.
- **A Capabilities tab on every agent.** Turn email on in the Email section's header, pick the one
  mailbox that agent may use, and choose Can send or Draft only (replies wait in that mailbox's
  Drafts). An agent restarts once, when it is not mid step, to pick up its mail tools.
- **Agents read, search and draft mail through their own mail tools**, refused for any mailbox
  you did not give them. A mailbox that stops accepting its password shows "needs you" in Settings
  and raises one Ask me card, closed once you fix or remove it.
- **The office opens again after closing time.** The next launch tells each agent the office is
  open, so held work and scheduled jobs run again. A job missed overnight runs once on opening,
  not once per missed hour. Cancelling closing time now tells every agent, not only Michael.

### Changed

- **Schedules live in Capabilities.** Each agent's jobs on a clock are the On a schedule section of
  its Capabilities tab. Michael's Schedules tab is now Office schedule: every job that is on, as a
  plain list, with a hint to change jobs on each agent's Capabilities tab.
- **Sections start closed** on every agent tab, and schedule rows show an open or closed arrow. An
  open schedule has a close or cancel button beside save.
- **Email through your Claude account is one switch** on the Your Claude account line in Mailboxes:
  allowed lets every agent use it, blocked stops everyone. It no longer affects the mailboxes you add.
- **Setup makes Michael's engine and model the team default.**
- **Settings is simpler.** Office theme, automatic updates, Slack and the read only server list are
  hidden in this build; the manual update check stays at the top.

### Fixed

- **Turning Email and Calendar off now blocks agents' mail and calendar tools**, not just the
  setting.
- **The Slack listener no longer starts while Slack is hidden.**

## [0.0.6] (2026-09-26)

### Changed

- **Setup fills in your legal name.** Step 2's legal name starts from the step 1 business name and
  follows a rename there, until you type a legal name of your own.
- **Setup marks every required field.** Business name and your kind of business carry a *, and the
  business tiles get the same red highlight as a missing field when you press Next without one.

### Fixed

- **Reset and Restart no longer throws while closing.** The inbox check that runs every few seconds
  could reach the office after reset had cleared its folder.
- **Reset and Restart in development no longer opens a blank window.** Under npm run dev the app
  now exits and says to run npm run dev again, since the dev server stops with the first window.

## [0.0.5] (2026-09-25)

### Added

- **Every agent has its own schedules.** Each agent's panel has a Schedules tab for its own jobs,
  with the next run on its card. Agents can ask for a schedule change, but only you decide: the
  request waits in ASK ME with Approve and Decline, and chat never changes a schedule. Closing an
  agent pauses its schedules and says so first. Michael's Schedules tab (it was called triggers)
  shows his own jobs and a read only view of the whole office.
- **Every agent's first tab is its Profile:** the job, what the agent does, what it asks you about
  first, its folder with an Open folder button, and the full instructions it works from. Michael's
  profile shows what he does, the team (click a name to open that agent) and what he knows about
  your business.
- **Every agent has a Memory tab** that reads like notes: grouped into your preferences, how to,
  facts and where things live, with where each came from and when. Procedures open to their steps,
  a fact past its check date is flagged, and notes waiting to be sorted in are counted. Show the
  file still shows the raw text. On Michael's tab the memory comes first, with one search box below.

### Changed

- **You talk to team members through Michael, except in 1:1.** Outside 1:1 a team member's terminal
  is watch only, and a bar offers Message Michael or Talk 1:1. 1:1 lives in that bottom bar. A team
  member stuck on a prompt in its terminal is reported to Michael, who raises it on ASK ME. The
  agent brakes (block tools, stop after this step) are hidden.
- **Only Michael sends desktop notifications.** Team members report to him, so their stops no longer
  reach your desktop.
- **The Messages tab reads like a history:** conversations grouped by day, each one line saying who
  asked what and how it was answered, with plain words instead of message types. Closing time and
  scheduled runs are counted on one line instead of filling the tab.
- **A newer question on a card replaces an unanswered older one** in ASK ME.
- **The fresh start note is a short note** with Bring back earlier chat and Hide, and it says when
  bringing the chat back fails.
- **Agent panel tabs** go profile, messages, schedules, memory, then the technical ones (terminal,
  traces), and work with the arrow keys.
- **Settings shows only what this build uses:** Prerequisites lists only Claude Code, uv and
  MemPalace, and the API keys panel is hidden.

### Fixed

- A schedule longer than about 24 days no longer fires nonstop: intervals stop at 24 days, and a
  time like 09:75 is refused instead of becoming 10:15.
- The Messages tab no longer rereads every message file every 5 seconds.
- The Memory tab's memory file fills the tab.
- Small text raised to the 13px minimum on the schedule rows and hints.

## [0.0.4] (2026-09-25)

### Changed

- **Names change only in Edit Agent.** Clicking or double clicking a name on a card or in a panel
  no longer starts renaming it, which mostly happened by accident. Renaming in Edit Agent now
  reaches Michael and the team, and a name another team member already has is refused. Michael's
  name can't be changed.
- **The app shows the new brand.** The header shows the Don't Be Michael lockup, and the window
  icon, the loading screen and the app icon show the Struck M, instead of the old portrait.

### Documentation

- **The README describes the small business office** that the app is today, with the new logo,
  instead of the original developer tool. Contributor documents no longer claim Windows and Linux
  releases or signed builds.

## [0.0.3] (2026-09-25)

### Changed

- **Every agent's folder is private.** A team member's folder opens only for that team member,
  anyone sharing the folder (agents in the same role do by default), and Michael, who can read his
  team's files but not change them. Michael's own folder opens only for him and you. Held by Claude
  Code's own sandbox and permission rules, and checked again by the app on every file an agent opens,
  including through links. A team member's shell commands can't switch the sandbox off.
- **Michael works in the business folder,** the one holding everyone's folders, so he can read his
  team's work. His conversation carries over. Setup now asks for this one folder, and the team's
  folders go inside it.
- **Company knowledge lives in Memory & Knowledge.** Company wide information, policies and rules
  are shared through the knowledge feature, which is now on for every office and which every agent,
  Michael included, is told to search. There is no shared Office folder any more: an existing one
  stays on disk as an ordinary folder inside Michael's. Turning it on or off in Settings now reaches
  agents that are already running on their next message, instead of at their next start.
- **A fresh start for idle team members, without losing work.** When a team member's conversation
  is large (50k tokens or more) and has sat idle for 30 minutes with nothing open (no open task
  card, empty inbox, no reply it is waiting on, no unanswered Ask me question), the app first asks
  it to write a handoff of anything unfinished, then clears its conversation. The new conversation
  starts with that handoff, its memory, Work style and the company profile. If new work arrives
  before the clear, it is cancelled. The earlier conversation is kept: the team member's panel says
  when it was cleared and offers to bring it back. Michael is never cleared. The clock based auto
  clear in Settings is gone.
- **A schedule says when and which job, not how.** Schedules no longer have a Prompt: the label
  names the job (for example "Follow up on unpaid invoices"), and the agent does it the way its Work style
  says. Every run sends the same short message, including a way to stop quietly when there is
  nothing to do. The hourly standup's instructions moved into Michael's own. A schedule that already
  had its own instructions keeps sending them, and its card offers to move them into that team
  member's Work style or remove them.
- **Ask me answers go back to whoever asked, and are remembered.** Each question on an Ask me
  card now records the team member whose work needs the answer (or Michael, for his own). Your
  answer goes straight to that agent, into its memory notes as your words, and Michael is told so he
  can unblock the card. The memory tidy-up keeps the lasting part, like a rule or a preference, so
  the same question isn't asked again.
- **Agents' memory improves instead of piling up.** Each agent's memory is now a short index of
  one line notes (at most about 2,000 tokens) that the app keeps and gives the agent once per
  session. Agents add at most three notes after a task, and your instructions and corrections at
  once, to their memory inbox; they no longer append session logs. In the background, a small model
  (Haiku) sorts the notes in with itemised changes, never rewriting the whole file: it merges
  duplicates, updates facts that changed (the old version goes to an archive), and turns steps that
  worked for a recurring task into a procedure file. It runs after about 10 notes, once a day, or
  when the office is idle. Closing time no longer writes session logs to memory; where work stands
  goes on the task board. Existing memory is sorted once, with the original backed up. This
  replaces the old condenser, which rewrote the whole file.
- **A company profile every agent works from.** Setup asks for the essentials (business name,
  industry, CEO or owner, headquarters address, website), then an optional Company details step:
  legal name and business type, main phone, public email, social links, business hours, time zone,
  where you serve, languages, currency and when your financial year starts. Time zone and currency
  start from your Mac. Every agent, Michael included, gets these facts at the start of each session
  and again when you change them in the new Settings, Company profile page. Anything longer (product
  lists, ideal customers, how you sell, policies) goes in Memory & Knowledge, which the page points to.
- **Company knowledge can be searched by meaning.** When MemPalace is installed, every document you
  add is indexed into it, so a search for "money back" finds your refund policy. Removed documents
  leave the index too. Without MemPalace, agents search by exact words as before.
- **House rules for every agent, Michael included.** Every agent now starts with five short rules:
  state only facts it can trace to a source and name the source, say so when it doesn't know,
  mark estimates as estimates, report outcomes as they are, and never make up people, customers or
  quotes.
- **Compaction is left to Claude Code.** The app no longer types `/compact` into idle agents every
  two hours, and its Settings control is gone. Each Claude agent now starts with Claude Code set to
  compact at about 300k tokens (models with a smaller window keep their usual point), instead of
  waiting until about 967k on 1M token models.
- **The standup no longer talks about compaction.** Keeping each agent's context small is the
  app's job, not something agents are told to do. An office still using the original standup text
  gets the new one; text you edited yourself is left as it is.
- **The standup runs every time the office opens.** Michael gets the hourly standup as soon as he's
  up, including a brand new office right after setup, then every hour from there. Before, the first
  one on a new office was lost, and a reopened office only got one when it was overdue.
- **Hiring asks for Role, Role description and Work style,** the same fields as Edit Agent. A new
  team member's folder goes inside Michael's, named after the role, so people in the same role
  share one. Michael's folder can't be picked as a team member's own folder.
- **New instructions for Michael and the team.** In an office with a business folder, Michael
  starts as the office manager of your business: he runs the team, sends work to whoever's role
  fits, and brings you only what needs you. Each team member starts knowing its job, who it reports
  to, and how to hand work back. Replies meant for you or for Michael reach Michael, whatever name
  an agent uses for him.
- **Each role in a business pack comes with its Role description and Work style,** written for
  that business, with your business name and city filled in. A new hire from a pack gets them.
- **Your existing team gets the new text too, once.** Each team member that came from a pack gets
  today's Role description and Work style when the app next opens. The team list is backed up to
  `roster-backups` first; if the backup fails, nothing changes. Team members you hired yourself are
  left as they are.
- **Michael gets the team list only when it changes,** instead of on every message, and a short
  status line when someone's status changes.
- **Plainer messages from the app.** The inbox nudge, the pause and stop notes, closing time, Slack
  requests and the message format reference are rewritten in plain words, and scheduled runs arrive
  as information rather than as tasks. Michael's role is "office manager".
- **Nothing is typed into Michael's terminal when he starts.** He no longer gets a remote control
  command or an orientation prompt; his instructions and the standup when the office opens cover it.

### Fixed

- **Setting up again no longer loses your team.** When setup finished on an office that already
  had a team, the floor could save Michael alone over the team's list. Setup now reads the
  office's team first, and any team member the office knows but the floor lost comes back.
- **Your office is found by its folder, not its name.** When setup finds an office on this Mac, it
  offers to continue with it: the same team, in the same folders, whatever business name you type.
  Setting up a new office gives it a folder of its own. The office keeps its own record in
  `office.json` in its folder.

- **Notifications name the person.** A desktop notification now reads "Michael: Waiting for you."
  instead of "god: Claude is waiting for your input", and each team member's notifications carry
  their own name.

- **"Close Office" and "Hide Office" in the menu.** They replace "Quit Don't Be Michael" and "Hide
  Don't Be Michael", which put the action and "Don't" side by side. Cmd+Q and Cmd+H work as before.

- **Edit a team member's engine from two short lists.** Provider and model are now dropdowns
  instead of rows of buttons, and the provider list shows the engines this app offers.

- **Only Claude Code can be picked, everywhere.** The hire dialog and Michael's engine and model
  pickers now offer the same engines as setup. The others are not ready to run
  an office member yet.

- **Role, Role description and Work style when editing a team member.** The old Description is
  split into a role and what the role covers, which Michael reads to decide who gets which work, and
  a save reaches him straight away. Goal is now Work style: how the team member does its work,
  which Michael doesn't see.

### Removed

- **No voice, for now.** Talking to Michael and dictating messages are switched off, along with
  the Voice tab in Settings.

- **No usage stats choice in setup or Settings.** The app sends no usage data, so it no longer
  asks about it.
- **No Auto / Pause switch in Michael's Command Center.** It held back every message queued for
  the team. Queued messages are always delivered now, and a pause saved earlier is cleared.
- **No "open" button next to edit.** It opened a Terminal window in the agent's folder, a developer
  tool. The terminal icons beside folders in Michael's Command Center are gone too.
- **No close button on team members.** It stopped a team member mid-task and took it off the floor,
  with no button to bring it back.
- **No "auto mode" text in the header bar.** It named a setting in words owners don't use. The
  setting itself is unchanged, in Settings under Autonomy & Budgets.

## [0.0.2] (2026-09-24)

### Changed

- **Setup runs again after updating from 0.0.1.** The app now keeps its settings in its own
  folder, `~/Library/Application Support/dontbemichael`. Settings, connected accounts and history
  from 0.0.1 are not carried over. Your team's folders in Documents are not touched, so using the
  same business name in setup finds them again. The old settings stay in
  `~/Library/Application Support/munder-difflin` until you delete that folder.
- **This app's own name and copyright.** The About panel, the installer and the project metadata
  name Don't Be Michael and its owner.

## [0.0.1] (2026-09-24)

The first release of Don't Be Michael: an AI office for small business owners.

### Added

- **Set up by business.** Setup asks for your business name and City, State, then your kind of
  business: restaurant, retail, professional services, home services, or SaaS and consulting. It
  explains that Michael is your office manager, then suggests a team for that business, and you pick
  who joins.
- **Office Packs.** Each business type is a pack that decides who is on the team and how each job
  reads for that trade. Every character keeps the job they had in the show, in every pack.
- **A folder for every team member.** Each works in their own folder under Documents, next to a
  shared Office folder where Michael works. The app's own working folder is kept for coordination,
  and agents are stopped from saving work there.
- **Real documents in Memory & Knowledge.** Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF and scanned documents are
  read (scans and photos through the Mac's own text recognition), with plain reasons when a file
  can't be read. Agents can read the same files in their folders.
- **OFFICE, TASKS and GRAPH views.** A switch in the corner of the floor shows the animated office,
  the whole task board (who is doing what, what is blocked, what is done), or who talks to whom.
  Each view opens with a short explanation.
- **Michael asks when no one fits.** A big job outside everyone's role goes on the Ask me board
  with suggestions, instead of Michael starting a new agent on his own.
- **"We can't find your office."** If the office folder is moved or deleted, launch asks where it
  went, instead of quietly starting an empty office in its place.

### Changed

- **Named Don't Be Michael.** The menu, window, installers and macOS permission prompts use the new
  name. Your data folder keeps its old name, so nothing is lost.
- **Claude Code only, Opus 5.5 recommended.** Setup offers Claude Code with a choice of Claude
  model, says a Claude Max plan keeps the office running all day, and falls back to Opus 5 on an
  older Claude Code. The model list, updates and links all come from this app's own repository.
- **A floor for owners.** Every launch opens on Michael, on his Ask me tab. Skills, webhooks, memory
  settings and agent upkeep moved to Settings, where they apply to the whole office. Monitor and
  Activity sit under an Advanced tab. Owner facing text is 14px or larger, in plain words, with no
  dashes, in English, Chinese and Arabic.

### Removed

- Git views, the code editor, temporary helper agents and the organisation trigger are hidden in
  this build. The floating memory panel on the office floor is gone; its settings are in Settings.
- The original project's promotions, community links and update source.
- Windows and Linux builds. This release ships a Mac installer only; the other platforms stay
  configured for later.

### Security

- The Mac app is sealed ad hoc until it can be signed with an Apple Developer ID, so a downloaded
  copy opens through Privacy & Security > Open Anyway instead of being reported as damaged. Updates
  arrive as a download link rather than installing in place until the app is signed.

### Fixed

- Document reading no longer freezes the app while it converts older Word and RTF files.
- Setup no longer hangs on "Saving" when something fails; it says what went wrong in plain words.
- Switching offices keeps your team on screen if the switch fails.
- Opening a team member's memory from the graph no longer sticks to that person later.
