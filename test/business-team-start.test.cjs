/**
 * Starting the team picked during onboarding (Decisions 44, 47): the step that
 * turns the finish screen's saved `businessTeam` into agents on the floor. It
 * lives inside the useHive hook, which does not load under node, so this pins
 * the rules in its source. The whole flow (finish → relaunch → Michael up →
 * each member spawned in its folder) needs an end-to-end run to prove.
 *
 * The rules, each of which fails quietly if lost:
 *  - it runs once: `businessTeamStarted` stops a second run, and a member the
 *    registry already has is skipped, so a crash midway never doubles a card;
 *  - one member failing to start does not stop the rest; it is saved, and each
 *    later launch tries the saved members and nobody else, so a member the
 *    owner removed never comes back;
 *  - the cards appear without taking the focus off Michael;
 *  - Michael works in the Office folder on a business install, and in the
 *    harness folder on an older one, exactly as before.
