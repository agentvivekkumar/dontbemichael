 * Bash sandbox (sandboxed Bash cannot reach the broker; an MCP server can), with
 * MD_BROKER_URL and MD_BROKER_TOKEN in its environment. Every tool call becomes
 * `POST <broker>/mail/<tool>`; the broker decides what this agent may do, so
 * this file holds no passwords and no rules.
 *
 * It answers every request with a result or a JSON-RPC error and never exits on
 * bad input (eng review F-7).
