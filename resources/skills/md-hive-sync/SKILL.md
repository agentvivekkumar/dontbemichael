## Hive Sync

Run the mandatory hive start-of-task steps:

1. **Memory** — your memory index was given to you at the start of this session. Procedure files it names are under `$AGENT_DIR/memory/`.

2. **Check inbox** — list and read all files in `$AGENT_DIR/inbox/` that are NOT in `inbox/.done/`. For each message:
   - Act on the message.
   - Move the handled file into `$AGENT_DIR/inbox/.done/` with `mv`.

3. **Report** — summarize any new inbox messages. Note any tasks assigned to you or information relevant to the current session.

4. **End-of-task reminder** — when you finish a task, add at most three short notes to `$AGENT_DIR/memory/inbox.md`, only for things you'd otherwise work out again: a researched fact with its source and date, steps that worked for a task you'll repeat, or an owner correction with the reason. Often there's nothing worth saving. Never write session logs or status updates there; the app tidies notes into your index.

Run `echo $AGENT_DIR` if the variable is not set to locate your agent directory under the hive root.
